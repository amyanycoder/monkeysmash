# monkeysmash

monkeysmash is a web app I am currently developing that uses symbolic natural language processing to pseudo-randomly generate surreal, abstract poems.  Symbolic natural language prcessing (symbolic nlp) is typically obsolete because of its inability to generate specific meanings when compared to machine-learning and neural-based nlp approaches-- however, in a surreal and abstract poem, this lack of specificity is a bug, not a feature.  The code to generate these poems will be written in Rust, and hosted using Flask.  I plan to host this app on plain html and css web pages, aesthetically harkening back to the golden age of Geocities.
